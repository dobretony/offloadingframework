The main concern for producers of new generation mobile devices, namely smartphones and accessories, is to keep them as small as possible, mobile for as long as possible and feature-rich. This proves to be a problem for most gadgets, as the implementation of new features and user-friendly interfaces usually have an impact on energy consumption. In this paper a method is proposed that helps prolong battery life of mobile gadgets, by employing a method known as code offloading. This thesis presents the fact that code offloading can also be beneficial when Bluetooth Low Energy is used as a communication channel instead of classic TCP/IP connectivity and provides a framework that helps smartphone application developers offload their most CPU-intensive tasks.
